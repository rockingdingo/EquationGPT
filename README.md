EquationGPT OpenAI Finetune Dataset
=================================== 

Introduction
================
This repo is to hold the public dataset for EquationGPT, which aims to collect Equation related Q&A corpus to finetune foundation models of GPT/ChatGPT.
Each prompt-completion pairs contains information about the latex code for the equation, the meaning of each symbols, and related materials. The dataset is collected from website http://www.deepnlp.org/equation/ and contains 8k+ prompt-completion pairs to finetune the GPT model.

See this OpenAI blog for details of how to finetune your GPT model. https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning.
